Stupid Draft Version:
Implement MNIST with Tensorflow
Implement MNIST with our custom NN

Actual Version:

Implement evolutionary algorithm behaviour with current NN implementation

Implement a snake game that can be hooked with the NN
OR
Figure out a better test case

Implement TensorFlow to work with the aforementioned Snake game (or another test case) to have data to compare our implementation with

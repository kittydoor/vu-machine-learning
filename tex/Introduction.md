In this project we mainly work on Neural Networks.
The aim is to find a algorithm which recognizes different digits written in different handwritings.
The we can compare this algorithm to other algorithm and find the algorithm with the highest accuracy.
Our data sample is The \bf{MNIST Database of handwritten digits}.
The dataset contains of a training set of 60000 examples and a test set of 10000 examples.
In the training dataset program will recognize the digits by dividing a digit into the different parts. The next step is to make different layers.

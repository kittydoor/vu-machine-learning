\section{Evaluation}

Using multiple algorithms, we use statistics to see which one performs the best.
We do this by first training the programs over and over again and looking at the values of the cost function.
We analyze the minimum T costs per algorithm to create a certain statistical distribution,
From this we get the mean, standard errors, etc.
Using this distribution, we estimate the optimal lowest cost per algorithm and test them against each other using the difference is in a simple test statistic.
This tells us which algorithm performs better in general.
